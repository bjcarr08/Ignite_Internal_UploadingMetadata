**Linking**

When creating links between pages in your site, you can provide the source file as the link target (rather than the .html file). You can also add hash identifiers (#) to the source file if you want to link to a particular section in the document. For example:

[Links](Links.qmd)

[FAQ's](FAQs.qmd#section)
